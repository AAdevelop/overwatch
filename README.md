# Overwatch
Overwatch is a simple web app that keeps tracks of items you want to buy an eBay.

* How it works
Using React,stdlib and ebay API, we search items based on your title and price range. Using stdlib's scheduling function, we check eBay ever minute to se if prices have changed. Once we find a listing, we send a link to your phone using twillio sms.
